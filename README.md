django-workflow
===============

Python Django application, which provides model auditing and history via admin paanel.

Combines [django-moderation](https://github.com/dominno/django-moderation) and [django-reversion](https://github.com/etianen/django-reversion) and supports history branching.

Models with inlines currently are not supported due to Django's internal mechanisms.
